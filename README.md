            box-shadow: 0 10px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);">
```

Recommended photo specs:
- **Size**: 300-400px wide

- **Aspect Ratio**: 3:4 (portrait)
- **Quality**: High resolution, professional headshot

## 🔧 Customizing Styles

To modify the website appearance, edit `/css/styles.css`:

### Common Customizations

**Change primary color:**
```css
/* Find this gradient */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #20c997, #17a2b8);

/* Replace with your colors */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #YOUR_COLOR1, #YOUR_COLOR2);
```

**Modify header:**
```css
/* Find */
header {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3c72 0%, #2a5298 100%);
    /* your changes here */
}
```

**Adjust font sizes:**
```css
/* Find specific element classes like */
.doctor-content h1 {
    font-size: clamp(2.5rem, 4vw, 3.2rem);
    /* adjust as needed */
}
```

## 🎯 What This Update Solves

### Before ❌
- Inline styles in every page
- Had to update CSS in 9+ places
- Mobile header took up half the screen
- No team member dropdown
- Only one provider page (Dr. Levinson)

### After ✅
- One CSS file controls all pages
- Update styles in one place
- Mobile header scrolls away nicely
- Professional team dropdown navigation
- Three complete provider profiles
- Consistent branding across site

---

## 🔐 EmailJS Integration

The appointment form still uses EmailJS and includes:
- **config.js** for API keys
- Automatic email notifications
- Google Sheets logging
- Google Calendar integration
- All functionality preserved from previous version

---

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

Special attention to mobile experience:
- Header is no longer sticky on mobile (doesn't block content)
- Touch-friendly navigation
- Responsive grid layouts
- Readable font sizes
- Optimized spacing

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Styles not loading?
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Verify `/css/styles.css` file exists and uploaded correctly
3. Check file path in HTML: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">`

### Dropdown not working?
- Dropdown uses CSS `:hover` for desktop
- Should work automatically on hover
- For mobile touch support, JavaScript can be added if needed

### Photos not showing?
- Verify image file paths
- Check image file names match HTML references
- Ensure images are in correct folder (usually `/images/`)

### Form not submitting?
- Verify `config.js` is uploaded
- Check EmailJS credentials are correct
- Look for console errors in browser developer tools
